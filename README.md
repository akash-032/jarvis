2.	Project Objective  
The project objective of a Virtual Assistant Mini Project typically revolves around demonstrating the fundamental capabilities and functionalities of a virtual assistant within a limited scope. Here are some common project objectives for such a mini project:

1. **Functional Demonstration**: To showcase the core functions of a virtual assistant, such as answering questions, performing simple tasks, and providing information or recommendations.

2. **User Interaction**: To allow users to interact with the virtual assistant through natural language conversations, offering a glimpse of its conversational abilities.

3. **Task Automation**: To illustrate how a virtual assistant can automate routine tasks or processes, potentially integrating with external applications or services.

4. **Voice Recognition**: If applicable, to implement voice recognition capabilities, enabling users to interact with the virtual assistant through spoken commands.

5. **Information Retrieval**: To demonstrate the virtual assistant's ability to access and retrieve information from a predefined knowledge base or database.

6. **User Experience**: To prioritize user experience by designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the virtual assistant.

7. **Learning and Adaptation**: If advanced, to implement machine learning algorithms that allow the virtual assistant to learn and adapt to user preferences over time.

8. **Scalability and Portability**: To ensure that the project can be easily expanded or adapted for different platforms or use cases in the future.

9. **Documentation and Training**: To provide documentation or user guides that explain how to use the virtual assistant and any potential customization options.

10. **Education and Exploration**: To serve as an educational tool, inspiring further exploration and experimentation with virtual assistant technologies.

11. **Testing and Evaluation**: To conduct testing and gather user feedback to assess the effectiveness and usability of the virtual assistant in its limited context.

12. **Performance Metrics**: If applicable, to define and measure key performance metrics, such as response time, accuracy, and user satisfaction.

13. **Security and Privacy**: To address security and privacy concerns, ensuring that user data is handled responsibly and securely.

14. **Integration Possibilities**: To explore potential integration points with other applications or services, highlighting the extensibility of virtual assistant technology.

15. **Proof of Concept**: To demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating virtual assistant capabilities into a broader project or application.

Our project is combination of four packages which are speech to text, translator and dictionary. 
       Steps for text to speech:-  
1.	Import libraries (gtts,tkinter,playsond) 
2.	Initializing window Using tkinter module 
3.	Create function to convert text to speech 
4.	Create function to exit 
5.	Create function to reset
   
    Steps for translator :- 
1-	Import module (googletrans) 
2-	Adding language to the project 
3-	Creating window using tkinter module 4- Create backend translate function
  	
    Steps for dictionary :- 
1-	Import module (pydictionary)
